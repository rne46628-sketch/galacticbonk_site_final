      <h1>G‑Bonk Whitepaper</h1>
      <p><em>Version 1.1 – August 2025</em></p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        G‑Bonk is a memecoin built on the Solana blockchain that aims to
        combine fun community engagement with serious utility. Memecoins
        have captured the imagination of the cryptosphere, but many lack
        long‑term plans. G‑Bonk differentiates itself by coupling a lively
        mascot and viral appeal with a clear roadmap and real‑world
        applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our freshly redesigned website reflects this philosophy: a seamless journey through a unified starry backdrop that
        highlights how easy it is to join the adventure. New holders can now acquire $GBONK directly via multiple trusted
        portals – Dexscreener, DexTools and the GMGN swap aggregator – using popular wallets such as Phantom or Binance Wallet.
        This variety ensures a smooth onboarding experience regardless of your preferred trading interface.
      </p>

      <h2>Vision &amp; Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Our vision is to create a vibrant ecosystem where holders are
        rewarded not only through speculative price appreciation but also
        through concrete utility. We will foster an inclusive community,
        provide innovative financial products and empower users to be part
        of a playful yet purposeful crypto project.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Invest in G‑Bonk?</h2>
      <p>
        Memecoins thrive on hype, but enduring value comes from substance.  G‑Bonk
        offers both.  The tokenomics are intentionally deflationary — a
        portion of the supply is permanently burned and the mint authority has
        been revoked — so the number of $GBONK in circulation can only
        decrease over time.  Liquidity is locked and a treasury funds
        future listings, marketing and partnerships.  The team allocation
        follows a vesting schedule to align long‑term incentives.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond the numbers, G‑Bonk is building real products.  Holders will
        soon be able to stake their tokens for yield, trade on our
        custom DEX (G‑Trade) and even use a fiat–crypto bridge (G‑Bank).  A
        thriving community of bonkers is already forming on X and
        Telegram, and the project has been listed on multiple DEXes and
        aggregators.  By participating early you’re helping to shape a
        meme with a mission — and positioning yourself for future
        rewards.
      </p>

      <h2>Tokenomics</h2>
      <p>
        G‑Bonk uses the SPL Token standard on Solana with six decimal
        places. The mint supply of <strong>865,958,249.418936 G‑BONK</strong>
        tokens is fixed; no future minting is possible. According to Solscan
        there are currently about <strong>367 holders</strong> and a portion
        of the initial mint has already been sent to the burn address,
        permanently removing those tokens from circulation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Distribution is designed for sustainability and clarity. We’ve
        divided the fixed supply into four main categories with actual
        numbers based on the current total supply of <strong>865,958,249
        tokens</strong>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>13 % burned forever – ~112 million tokens</strong> have been sent
        to the burn address, permanently removing them from circulation. This
        deflationary mechanic increases scarcity over time.</li>
        <li><strong>23 % locked in treasury &amp; liquidity – ~199 million
        tokens</strong> are locked in liquidity pools and the community treasury
        to stabilise price, support DEX listings and fund partnerships.</li>
        <li><strong>17 % team &amp; development – ~147 million tokens</strong> are
        allocated to the team and core developers under a vesting schedule
        to incentivise continued development, marketing and maintenance.</li>
        <li><strong>47 % circulating supply – ~407 million tokens</strong> are in
        the hands of the community and available for trading, staking and
        governance.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Transaction fees on Solana remain tiny, ensuring inexpensive
        transfers and swaps for all bonkers.
      </p>

      <h2>How to Acquire $GBONK</h2>
      <p>
        Acquiring G‑Bonk is straightforward thanks to a selection of user‑friendly portals and wallets.  Follow these steps:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Get a wallet:</strong> Install a Solana‑compatible wallet such as Phantom or Binance Wallet to hold your tokens and interact with decentralised apps.</li>
        <li><strong>Fund with SOL:</strong> Purchase a small amount of SOL on your exchange of choice and transfer it to your wallet.  SOL is used to pay for transaction fees on the Solana blockchain.</li>
        <li><strong>Swap for G‑Bonk:</strong> Navigate to Dexscreener, DexTools or the GMGN aggregator using the official pair address.  These platforms allow you to swap SOL for $GBONK and display live charts and liquidity information.</li>
        <li><strong>Store and stake:</strong> Once acquired, store your G‑Bonk in your wallet and prepare for upcoming staking opportunities.  Staking will let you earn yield while supporting network security.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Use Cases</h2>
      <p>
        Beyond simple transfers, G‑Bonk will power several products:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Staking:</strong> Holders can stake G‑Bonk to earn additional tokens and participate in governance.</li>
        <li><strong>G‑Trade:</strong> An exchange platform launching in Q1 2026 that uses fees in G‑Bonk to incentivise liquidity and burn part of the supply.</li>
        <li><strong>G‑Bank:</strong> A traditional bank launching in Q3 2026 combining fiat and cryptocurrency products to bridge decentralised and traditional finance.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Roadmap</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Q3 2025 – Token Launch:</strong> Deployment of the G‑Bonk token on Solana and initial DEX listings.</li>
        <li><strong>Q4 2025 – Staking:</strong> Introduction of a staking program with dynamic rewards.</li>
        <li><strong>Q1 2026 – G‑Trade:</strong> Launch of G‑Trade, an exchange platform that uses fees in G‑Bonk.</li>
        <li><strong>Q3 2026 – G‑Bank:</strong> Launch of G‑Bank, a traditional bank with a combination of fiat money and cryptocurrency.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Security &amp; Compliance</h2>
      <p>
        The G‑Bonk contract is immutable: mint and freeze authorities are
        renounced to prevent further supply changes. We encourage users to
        verify the contract on Solscan and use reputable wallets such as Phantom or Binance Wallet when acquiring or storing tokens.
        As regulatory frameworks evolve, the project will adhere to applicable
        jurisdictions and best practices for transparency.
      </p>

      <h2>Community &amp; Culture</h2>
      <p>
        G‑Bonk thrives on an active community of “bonkers” who share memes, spread the word and contribute ideas.  Our presence on X and Telegram is buzzing, with regular contests, giveaways and AMAs to keep everyone engaged.  We believe that a strong, positive culture is the foundation of long‑term value — after all, a meme is only as strong as its community.
      </p>
      <p>
        Joining our community gives you access to exclusive updates, early testing of upcoming products and a voice in governance decisions.  We encourage everyone to participate constructively and help build a welcoming environment for new bonkers.
      </p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        G‑Bonk is more than a meme. It combines the joy of community
        participation with a realistic roadmap and utility. By joining
        forces, our holders will help shape the future of decentralised
        finance and entertainment on Solana.
